## FAQ

Q: “Why not submit these themes to WordPress.org official repository?”

A: Their theme reviewer thinks my theme “just offer a few minor CSS tweaks and adds new footer credit links” [#](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10728).

Update: After a [3-month long review](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61256), Kai 12 is now listed on official WordPress theme directory.
