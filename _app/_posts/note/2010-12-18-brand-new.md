Recently this site has several downtime because I was moving my server from one to another. And if you've subscribed my site you’ll noticed that all my posts refreshed in your RSS reader. Sorry about that, you can just ignore them, they’re all old posts except this one, just post here to let you know that the site is up and runing now, RSS (Atom) feed will also work (I hope). At last let me tell you what I did these days:

- Switched from [Linode](https://linode.com/) to [Rackspace](https://www.rackspacecloud.com/), unmanaged cloud server.
- Apache to nginx.
- WordPress to [Stacey](https://github.com/kolber/stacey), `UPDATE:` finally switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- Deleted almost all my posts, it’s brand new now.
- Categories changed, only two categories now: Work and Nootebook.
